payroll
=======

Payroll system for a small business in the Philippines. Each employee's daily timecard is entered in the system and 
the weekly payroll is generated along with monthly and annual reports of the payroll.

The UI is written in AngularJS. There is no backend server, data is stored in IndexedDB on the browser with the ability
to export the data to a json file as backup.

The absence of the backend server is to simplify management of the program as the intended usage is only for 1 user 
running the payroll for the business.
